# Docker-LEMP

A Docker LEMP Stack based on Phusion Base Image + Nginx + MariaDB with Sphinx and Redis containers (tba)

## Getting Started
Currently the following things are true

* The www directory in the nginx folder is the webroot
* The mariadb remote password is autogenerated on docker build
* Dot files are created to allow you to reuse buildall.sh (ensure you delete these if you need to rebuild else the data only containers wont be created and the MariaDB admin password wont be set)
* The containers are linked
* A data only container is created for the database (I'm not currently feeling this, I think I would prefer a directory mapped to host but meh)
* There is no Sphinx and Redis Container (Yet! I'm wanting to get the base LEMP stack setup properly first)
* This would probably all be MUCH easier with docker-compose but its a great learning tool to see how it's done

By all means chuck some pull requests my way, if there is anything I am being particularly retarded about let me know the reasons why, it has been a struggle trying to get everything together reliably.
